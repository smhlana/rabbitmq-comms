# rabbitmq-comms
A simple solution to demonstrate how RabbitMQ is used for communication between two console applications, a sender and a receiver.

It is created in Visual Studio 2017.
There are two solutions, Producer and Consomer, containing the Producer and Consumer class libraries respectively. The Producer class is driven by the Send class and the Consumer is driven by the Receive class.

There are two ways to run this project.
1. Visual Studio
  Open the two projects (Producer.sln and Consumer.sln) on seperate Visual Studio instances and run both projects.
  
2. Install .exe
  There are two .exe files provided, CommReceiver_setup.exe and CommSender_setup.exe. Run both files to install the sender and receiver,     then run the CommReceiver and CommSender desktop applications that are installed.
